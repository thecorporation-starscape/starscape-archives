THE BATTLE OF OASPEDFIN
The largest battle in recent Starscape history has taken place between the Foralkus, supported by the FCA and Kavani/Lycentia supported by the Federal Mandate. The battle took place in Oaspedfin and surrounding systems, with player counts peaking at around 45. The height of the battle would result in the destruction of around 20 destroyer-class ships.

Battle Timeline:
- A Foralkan fleet of around 20 ships was capturing Kavani systems, when minor Kavani and Lycentian forces were encountered in small skirmishes taking place throughout the Oaspedfin area.
- As the Foralkan fleet moved into Oaspedfin, a Kavani/Lycentian fleet of around 25 ships was waiting at the warp point, Planet 10, to engage the Foralkan fleet.
- The resulting battle was a close quarters battle between massive destroyer fleets, the Foralkan force would fallback to Winlo after minor losses.
- The final major engagement of the battle would take place at Planet 6, as the Foralkans chased the Kavani/Lycentian force and engaged the enemy once again in battle and both sides would suffer losses of large portions of their fleets.
- Eventually, the Kavani/Lycentian force decided to call a retreat, with all remaining ships evacuating the area, allowing the Foralkans to secure Oaspedfin.
