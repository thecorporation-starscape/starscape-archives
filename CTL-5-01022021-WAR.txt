FLEET BATTLE IN MUEX
A fleet battle involving around 70 people occurred at Muex today, with the opposing sides being WARDEN/NOTO and NATO. This battle was scheduled between both parties to occur at 3:00pm EST. After NATO went into Planet-9 and formed a defensive line, WARDEN warped in and formed their own. What followed was a ranged battle as both sides attempted to snipe at each other. This continued for 10-15 minutes until NATO retreated to Planet 12, allowing WARDEN to ambush any left ships. After these events occurred, NATO and WARDEN remained in their respective planets until WARDEN jumped out of the system, ending the battle. Both fleets after that engaged in several skirmishes, resulting in more ships being lost.
