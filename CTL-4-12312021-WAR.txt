SKIRMISH IN EMAS
A skirmish involving around 22 people occurred in Emas today between WARDEN and NATO. After an earlier encounter, WARDEN became aware of a NATO presence in Emas, and rallied to begin an attack. As WARDEN forces entered the system, almost all of NATO left the system while leaving behind a single fighter. WARDEN divided it's forces to maintain control over planets 2 and 3 to pursue the last NATO fighter. Unknown to WARDEN, a large NATO fleet of destroyers were logged off in a nearby system and once it had been determined that WARDEN was ill-prepared to defend against a major attack, the green light was given. A WARDEN Horizon was destroyed by the NATO assault, and they would manage to take down the rest of the WARDEN forces in the ensuing ground battle.
